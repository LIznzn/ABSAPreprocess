Room Was Acceptable,B O O
The room was nice and the furnishings were comfortable .,O B O O O O B O O O
The food from the restaurant was very good but pricey which was the standard for everything in this hotel .,O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The internet access from the room was $ 9.95 for a 24 hour period .,O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
To check in for my flight using the business center cost me $ 4.59 which included three minutes use of the internet and printing seven pages for my boarding pass .,O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I liked the hotel with the exception of being charged for things other hotels provide free .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Staff was very pleasant and helpful .,B O O O O O O
Great stay !,O O O
I booked here as I had a conference to attend at this hotel for 3 days .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What a wonderful choice .,O O O O O
Check in was fast and courteous .,B I O O O O O
"Rooms were clean , spacious and comforatable .",B O O O O O O O
"Food was outstanding , for both the conference and on my own .",B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pool was refreshing on the hot days .,B O O O O O O O
Overall for the price of this hotel it cannot be beat !,O O O O O O B O O O O O
I will definitely stay here again conference or not .,O O O O O O O O O O
Good Business Hotel,O O B
Very nice hotel for business travelers - very few kids .,O O B O O O O O O O O
Great rooms with very comfortable beds .,O B O O O B O
"Big pool area , very good fitness center - nice lobby and common areas .",O B I O O O B I O O B O B I O
I had excellent shuttle service .,O O O B I O
The Sports Bar had good food with very reasonable prices .,O O O O O B O O O O O
The only downside was a per minute charge to use the business center computers .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
Perfectly Close to the Airport,O O O O O
I booked this because of it's proximity to the airport for our departure .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The staff was friendly and helpful , they upgraded our room to queen beds without us asking .",O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The rooms are lovely , and the hotel is quiet even though it is so close to the airport .",O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The 24 hour shuttle to the airport is very , very convenient and gets you there in about 4 minutes .",O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We ate at the restaurant and the food was good hearty and the best avocado I've ever had.....so all in all you can't beat the deal , the location , the clean rooms , and the service .....",O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O B O
A Great Hotel,O O B
Our stay at this hotel was wonderful .,O O O O B O O O
The staff was very courteous upon check-in .,O B O O O O O O
Our room was perfectly spotless .,O B O O O O
"( I had to use an outlet behind the headboard , and expected to see some type of dirt when I pulled the bed out , but to my surprise , not even dust !)",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Very clean and well maintained .,O O O O O O
Some nice touches of southwest decor here and there .,O O O O O O O O O O
"No problems whatsoever , and I would recommend this hotel to anybody .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Good service but rude desk clerk,O B O O B I
"Oct.7 , 2006 I arrived at the hotel and went to the front desk to check in .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The desk clerk was checking my information in the computer and I asked her if there were any suites available as I had called the hotel a week before my arrival and and was assured that I could upgrade to a suite .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She immediately began to yell that if I wanted an upgrade I would have to pay for it .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"When I went to my room , I took the AAA Tour Book back to the desk and showed her where it specifically stated that the reservation could be upgraded if a suite was available and it would be free of charge .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The same desk clerk started to yell again stating that she had told me when I called that I could upgrade for a charge and that was her rules .,O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In fact I had spoken to a gentleman when I had called the week before , I never spoke to a lady .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I asked her why she was raising her voice and if this was the way she spoke to guests .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She completely ignored me and just kept on yelling .,O O O O O O O O O O
I asked to speak to the manager and she told me she was the manager when in fact the manager's name was clearly displayed on the wall .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She walked away from the desk and the manager came to assist me about 10 mins later .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This incident was very humiliating as other guests were present .,O O O O O O O O O O O
I am writing this review because this kind of behavior was totally unacceptable and hopefully no other guests will be treated in this manner .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Overall service was great and the staff as a whole were very courteous and helpful .,O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Not bad for one night,O O O O O
Stayed on a Sunday night .,O O O O O O
Front desk staff were friendly and helpful both with early check-in and an early check-out .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Room was large and spacious , but rather bland .",B O O O O O O O O O
"Excellent for a business traveler , or for a stayover with early departure to Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport , took 8 minutes to get to the airport via 10 freeway .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ideal location .,O B O
Very affordable rate at low $50s.,O O O O O O
"The pool looked nice , as did their restaurant , but didn't try either one .",O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Well below average,O O O
I was looking for an above-average traveler's hotel for a one-night stay .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Unfortunately , this is below average .",O O O O O O O
"Rooms are large but very plain , with furnishings and fixtures as cheap as possible .",B O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
The hotel shows its age and badly needs refurbishing .,O B O O O O O O O O
Bathroom sink was on a slight slant because it was pulling out of the wall .,B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nothing is especially terrible or unacceptable about this hotel .,O O O O O O O O B O
It is just subpar .,O O O O O
Don't do it !!,O O O O
"This place is run down , dirty and loud .",O B O O O O O O O O
The pictures they provide on the web do not tell the story so don't be fooled .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Great Restaurant,O B
This property has really improved since our last stay .,O B O O O O O O O O
"Room was cool , clean and comfy .",B O O O O O O O
The restaurant downstairs is the best kept secret in the area !,O B O O O O O O O O O O
The food and service was outstanding ( try the seafood platter ).,O B O B O O O O O B I O
Staff was courteous and efficient .,B O O O O O
I keep on coming back !,O O O O O O
I've been going to this place every year and I keep on coming back to this hotel .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The reason why ?,O O O O
The breakfast is excellent !,O B O O O
"It is rare that hotels in this class serve hot meals , yet they do !",O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Breakfast is fit for a king .,B O O O O O O
"Plus , the staff at the front desk are always courteous and friendly .",O O O B I I I I O O O O O O
"Though the bathrooms are a bit old , the beds are still cozy .",O O B O O O O O O B O O O O
And the hotel is right in the middle of everywhere .,O O B O O O O O O O O
Above average hotel for great price !,O O B O O O O
Got a great price of $ 64 per night .,O O O O O O O O O O
"The room was perfect for me , the bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever had in a hotel .",O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Five fluffy pillows - no slabs of foam rubber concrete that most hotels provide - and a snow white down comforter .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Very clean , great service - they gave me a complimentary bottle of wine because I missed the hotel shuttle .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Good restaurant and bar attached .,O B O B O O
Close to Scottsdale and the University .,O O O O O O O
I will never diss Paris Hilton again !,O O O O O O O O
Price was right,O O O
Pleasantly surprised at $ 69 night .,O O O O O O O
"Front desk was not helpful , but who cares...for $ 69 you get a clean , fairly-large room , central air , refrig/micro , free ( but sparse ) breakfast buffet .",B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Stayed there because it was near Banner Hospital .,O O O O O O O O O
Friendly Staff,O B
We stayed here at the beginning and end of a trip to Arizona so we were here during two differernt weekends .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The staff was extremely helpful and friendly .,O B O O O O O O
I would say they are the best part of the hotel !,O O O O O O O O O O O O
"An elevator was broken during our last stay and it was most annoying , but did not greatly impact the overall experience .",O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We found the place quiet , the complimentary breakfast a notch above some others at similar chain hotels , and the parking adequate .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All in all it is a nice and affordable spot for sightseeing in the area .,O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Administrative Issues,O O
The Best Western Executive Park Hotel is an average place to stay ( though a bit far from downtown ) with a substandard management team .,O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
I've tried to obtain a receipt for my stay to replace one I lost and have been ignored .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There's never anyone to talk to from management and phone calls/e mails receive no response .,O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
It's not a recipe for another stay .,O O O O O O O O
Not impressed,O O
The desk person was in a rude mood .,O B I O O O O O O
There was construction being done on the street in front of the hotel ; which made it very difficult driving around .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The air conditioner was very loud .,O B I O O O O
Nothing told us that there was a free breakfast - the restaurant looked like it was closed .,O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
All in all the price was way too high for such a poor accomodations .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Extremely reasonable for the price paid .,O O O O O O O
Excellent service .,O B O
"I was there 3 nights for a conference and am giving it 5 stars , as it was quite reasonably priced for what we received .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The staff was friendly overall .,O B O O O O
"Of course , it's not the Four Seasons , but the stay was pleasant ....",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Airport shuttle service was convenient as I chose not to rent a car during this trip .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"No complaints about the room , pretty clean .",O O O O B O O O O
I went to the lunch buffet twice and had a nice meal and again at very reasonable price .,O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was a few restaurants within walking distance to eat at as well .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The conference/banquet room was great .,O B I O O O
"Very accomodating , good acoustics , clean .",O O O O O O O O
"Not sure where the location was in reference to tourist spots , etc....but for a local conference , it was perfect .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Nice hotel , nice location for the valley",O B O O B O O O
I stayed here for spring training this last weekend .,O O O O O O O O O O
I got a great deal of 120 USD for 2 nights from priceline .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"I really liked the hotel , it was very clean , the staff were fantastic and the rooms were great .",O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O
I cant complain about this hotel stay .,O O O O O B O O
the location is in the central valley so getting to anywhere is easy with the easy access to the local freeways .,O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"the only drawback was that the pool pool area this time of year didnt seem to get much sun during the day , but the water is heated so it didnt matter too much .",O O O O O O B B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I would absolutely stay here again !!,O O O O O O O
"I didn't expect much , but ...",O O O O O O O
I was pleasantly surprised .,O O O O O
My flight was delayed so I was put up in this hotel .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"I expected it to be a dingy motel , but to my surprise , the rooms were clean and even a little spacious .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
"Obviously it wasn't the Ritz Carlton , but I can't say how relieving it is to come to a clean , comfortable room after a ten hour stay in an airport terminal .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The continental breakfast was excellent .,O B I O O O
"If all you want is a clean place to stay without the frills , and especially if you're a business traveler , stay here .",O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They seem to have businesspeople in mind .,O O O O O O O O
Loved this hotel overall,O O B O
We loved this hotel .,O O O B O
We stayed there the day we flew in and then the night before we flew out .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was close to the airport .,O O O O O O O
"The hotel staff was very friendly , the rooms were very clean , both times .",O B I O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The rooms were quiet .,O B O O O
"The pool was great and quiet both times , loved the lighted palm trees at night .",O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The breakfast buffet was unbelievable , everything you could imagine and a wonderful lady taking care of it .",O B I O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
The 2nd night we stayed there we had a king jacuzzi suite .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Awesome suite , 2 bathrooms , sinks and showers seperated by french doors .",O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also 2 flat sceen tvs and lots of space in each room .,O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The only complaint I had is that our suite smelled like smoke and it was a non smoking suite .,O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
We turned on both air conditioners to get rid of the smell and it wouldn't go away .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"I would highly recommend the hotel , great location , great service , good value .",O O O O O B O O B O O B O O O O
Convienient Comfortable business travel Hotel,O O O O B
This was my third stay in two months and I have noticed a continuing trend of upgrades and service .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Understand the property is under new management and it really shows .,O O B O O O O O O O O O
Prices are competitive especially against the downtown megaprops who charge you for standing still in one spot too long .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nice little bar and restaurant on site and easy walking distance to trendy bistros ( Portland's a really nice hip restaurant is immediately next door .),O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recommend this highly for the seasoned Pheonix road warrior or warriorette .,O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Clean , decent hotel",O O O B
Stayed at this hotel 1/20-1/21 to attend a conference .,O O O O O O O O O O
"The hotel was clean , rooms were large and comfortable , nothing fancy .",O B O O O B O O O O O O O O
"No noise , though hotel was half empty I'm extremely sensitive to noise at hotels and was not disturbed both evenings or in the mornings .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Is an older building but appeared to be well maintained .,O O O B O O O O O O O
Interior corridors clean and well lit .,B I O O O O O
Exterior grounds well kept .,B I O O O
Has elevators on both sides of the building .,O O O O O O O B O
"Has a nice pool and very hot jaquizzi , was clean .",O O O B O O O B O O O O
"The pool was well heated so swimming was possible in the winter climate , even at night .",O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Hotel provides free pass to Golds Gym , a five minute walk from front door .",B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Staff was freindly and professional for the most part .,B O O O O O O O O O
"Has good airport shuttle , ten minutes unless heavy traffic , then at worst 20 minutes .",O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Its convienently located in southeast phoenix , right next to Tempe .",O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Nice neghborhood , safe .",O B O O O
Would stay again .,O O O O
"Good conference facilities too , set up well .",O B I O O O O O O
"""best"" Best Western",O B I
This hotel is the best Best Western I have stayed in .,O O O O O B I O O O O O
Not especially attractive outside or surrounding area but convenient location and walk to small strip malls c eateries .,O O O B O B I O O B O O O O O O O O O
Inside hotel is cool and southwestern .,O B O O O O O
Hotel desk staff was friendly .,B I I O O O
"There is a complimentary shuttle that goes anywhere in 5 mi area , including airport , and runs early am until about 10 pm .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Free high speed internet .,O O O B O
Very comfortable room .,O O B O
Pool area clean but not very attractive .,B I O O O O O O
"Two dificulties I had were : One , the restaurant service was terrible !",O O O O O O O O O B I O O O
"It opens at 6 am which was great for the sightseeing tours and my breakfasts were all free , but once had to finally open the kitchen door and ask to be seated .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Then wait to give order , then wait for the food .",O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food selection was pretty good .,O B I O O O O
One time the employee stopped to pick up dirty plates as he led me to my seat !,O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The other problem was the hotel manager - a young woman apparently somewhat new at her job .,O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
She tried to refuse my gold crown club points as payment for my stay .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"When I was persistent , she made a phone call and I heard her say well , i never heard of that .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then she credited me for my points .,O O O O O O O O
I would definitely stay here again when in the Phoenix area !,O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Good motel , Poor location",O B O O B
We stayed at this hotel for four nights .,O O O O O O O O O
"My overall sense is that this was a good motel , comparatively inexpensive .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Pros :,O O
- Comparatively inexpensive,O O O
"- Microwave , refrigerator , coffee maker in room",O O O O O O O O B
"- Decent ( but repetitive ) breakfast included in price (wafles, scrambled eggs , cereal , etc .)",O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
- Free internet access ( including printing ) from lobby,O O B I O O B O O O
- Nice staff,O O B
Cons :,O O
- Average room size .,O O B O O
- Very limited space to hang clothes,O O O B O O O
My biggest problem was the location .,O O O O O B O
It was far away from all the sites I wanted to see .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
M .,O O
Great airport location,O O B
I stayed 1 night at the Hilton near the Phoenix airport .,O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was very quiet considering being so close to the airport .,O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Very clean and comfortable room , helpful and friendly staff .",O O O O B O O O O B O
The food in the Bar and Grille was just ok .,O B O O O O O O O O O
There is a charge for internet access in the room but it works great .,O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
You can print boarding passes at a kiosk near the front desk but it can be busy first thing in the morning so you might want to do it the day before .,O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I left on the 7:00am shuttle and the ride to the airport was quick and hassle-free .,O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Excellent !,O O
Wow ! What a great hotel !,O O O O O B O
"Rooms were clean , easy accessible .",B O O O O O O
Beds were so comfortable !,B O O O O
Staff was friendly .,B O O O
"Pool was heated , had a great atmosphere with unlimited bottled water available while swimming/laying out .",B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Offered food and drink service at the pool .,O O O O O O O B O
Room service was great !,B I O O O
Prompt delivery and wonderful food .,O B O O B O
I had the southwestern ceasar - it was one of the best salads I've ever had !,O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
I was very impressed and would come back to the HIlton Phoenix Airport again !,O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
DO NOT STAY HERE,O O O O
My family had 5 rooms at this hotel for one night .,O O O O O O O O O O O O
"One room was on one floor , 3 were on another , and the last was way up top .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Being way spread out would have been OK until we got to the rooms .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All 4 lower rooms were 80 degrees and above .,O O O B O O O O O O
We were assured that the rooms would be cool by the time we got back from our concert .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After the concert we had to change 4 of the rooms twice trying to find cooler floors .,O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
We finally gave up at 12:30 a.m . with a room that was 77 degrees - still too warm .,O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
And the room did not even have a shower curtain !,O O B O O O O O O O O
"I understand they are going through renovations , but they need to either do it floor by floor and close that floor or close the entire hotel until finished .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
The only nice thing was the free shuttle to America West Arena .,O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Very disappointing,O O
Lots of services promised and not provided .,O O B O O O O O
"The shuttle wasn't running , and the restaurant was closed down - both of those explained to me with because business is low right now around the holidays .",O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So I guess you should make sure it's going to be busy when you go !,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The business center has been taken apart - the front desk staff did not know if it was going to be back , since they had no idea it had been taken apart and were quite shocked to find out , when they tried to let me in to use it .",O B I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Vending machines were out of everything except in the lobby .,B I O O O O O O O O O
Staff was very friendly and a bit embarrassed about everything that wasn't available .,B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The room itself was fine .,O B O O O O
Pay extra and stay somewhere else,O O O O O O
This has to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed in !,O O O O O O B O O O O O O
And I was there 20 days on business needless to say I didnt pay for it !,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their was no HOT WATER !,O O O O O O
The beds are very hard .,O B O O O O
The staff was friendly .,O B O O O
No wifi only in the hotel lobby .,O O O O O O O O
"If you get a suite with a stove dont except dishes , pots and pans they do not provide them you have to buy your own .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pay the 20 extra and stay somewhere's else,O O O O O O O O
"Great hotel , great location , great price",O B O O B O O O
I had a great time at this hotel and did not experience any of what the bad reviews are about .,O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The staff was very friendly and helpful , the rooms were large and comfortable , the free breakfast was great , and the location downtown was excellent .",O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O
The free shuttle to and from the airport saved us over 30 dollars alone in taxi cab fare ( Phoenix Taxi fares are ridiculously expensive ) and is also available anywhere downtown .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in downtown Phoenix .,O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
